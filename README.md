A terminal-based tool that acts as a comprehensive health check for your AWS accounts. Built with Golang, **aws-doctor** diagnoses cost anomalies, detects idle resources, and provides a proactive analysis of your cloud infrastructure—effectively giving you the insights of AWS Trusted Advisor without the need for a Business or Enterprise support plan.

## Features

- **📉 Cost Comparison:** Compares costs between the current and previous month for the exact same period (e.g., comparing Jan 1–15 vs Feb 1–15) to give a fair assessment of spending velocity.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is not available on the **1st day of the month** as AWS Cost Explorer requires a minimum 24-hour range (Start date must be before End date).

- **🏥 Waste Detection (The "Checkup"):** Scans your account for "zombie" resources and inefficiencies that are silently inflating your bill.
- **📊 Trend Analysis:** Visualizes cost history over the last 6 months to spot long-term anomalies.
- **🔐 MFA Support:** Fully supports AWS profiles that require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to assume roles.

## Motivation

As a Cloud Architect, I often need to check AWS costs and billing information. While the AWS Console provides raw data, it lacks the immediate context I need to answer the question: _"Are we spending efficiently?"_

I created **aws-doctor** to fill that gap. It doesn't just show you the bill; it acts as a diagnostic tool that helps you understand **where** the money is going and **what** can be cleaned up. It automates the routine checks I used to perform manually, serving as a free, open-source alternative to the paid recommendations found in AWS Trusted Advisor.
